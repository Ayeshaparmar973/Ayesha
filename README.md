Traffic Data Analysis and Visualization
Overview
This project processes traffic data from a CSV file, analyzes the traffic volume by various metrics (hourly, junction-based), and visualizes the patterns using different types of plots:

Bar Chart: Shows vehicle counts over time (by DateTime).
Bar Chart: Displays total vehicle counts per junction.
Radar Chart: Visualizes the cyclic traffic pattern throughout the day (average vehicles per hour).
Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating visualizations.
NumPy: For numerical operations (used in the radar chart).
You can install these dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
Code Breakdown
1. Reading and Inspecting the Traffic Data
The following code reads the traffic data from a zip-compressed CSV file and inspects the first few rows and columns:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load traffic data from a zip-compressed file
traffic_data = pd.read_csv("/content/traffic.csv (2) (2).zip")

# Print the first few rows and the column names of the dataset
print(traffic_data.head())
print(traffic_data.columns)
Purpose: To load the CSV data and display the initial rows and column names so you can verify the structure of the data (e.g., DateTime, Vehicles, and Junction).
2. Visualizing Traffic Volume by DateTime (Bar Chart)
This code generates a bar chart that shows the total number of vehicles over time:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot traffic volume by DateTime
plt.bar(traffic_data['DateTime'], traffic_data['Vehicles'])
plt.xlabel('DateTime')
plt.ylabel('Vehicles')
plt.title('Vehicles by DateTime')
plt.show()
Purpose: This visualization shows how the vehicle count fluctuates at different times (DateTime) using a bar chart.
3. Aggregating and Visualizing Traffic Volume by Junction
This code aggregates the total vehicle count by junction and visualizes it using a bar chart:

python
Copy code
# Aggregate data to get total vehicles per junction
junction_traffic = traffic_data.groupby('Junction')['Vehicles'].sum().reset_index()

# Create a bar graph for total vehicles at each junction
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.bar(junction_traffic['Junction'], junction_traffic['Vehicles'], color='skyblue')
plt.title('Total Vehicles by Junction', fontsize=14)
plt.xlabel('Junction', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Total Vehicles', fontsize=12)
plt.xticks(junction_traffic['Junction'])
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
Purpose: This bar chart visualizes the total number of vehicles at each junction, allowing us to compare traffic volume across different junctions.
4. Analyzing Hourly Traffic and Visualizing with a Radar Chart
The final part of the code extracts the hour from the DateTime column, aggregates traffic by hour, and visualizes the hourly traffic pattern using a radar chart:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Convert DateTime column to pandas datetime type
traffic_data['DateTime'] = pd.to_datetime(traffic_data['DateTime'])

# Extract hour from the DateTime column
traffic_data['Hour'] = traffic_data['DateTime'].dt.hour

# Aggregate vehicle counts by hour
hourly_traffic = traffic_data.groupby('Hour')['Vehicles'].mean()

# Prepare data for radar chart
labels = hourly_traffic.index
values = hourly_traffic.values
labels = np.append(labels, labels[0])  # Close the circle
values = np.append(values, values[0])  # Close the circle

# Radar plot setup
angles = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, len(labels), endpoint=True)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8), subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'})
ax.plot(angles, values, linewidth=2, linestyle='solid', label='Average Vehicles per Hour')
ax.fill(angles, values, color='blue', alpha=0.25)

# Add labels
ax.set_thetagrids(angles * 180 / np.pi, labels)
ax.set_title("Cyclic Traffic Pattern (Hourly)", va='bottom')
ax.legend(loc='upper right')

plt.show()
Purpose: This radar chart visualizes the cyclic pattern of traffic throughout the day, showing average traffic volumes per hour.
Example Usage
Step 1: Ensure your dataset (traffic.csv) is available in the specified directory or update the path accordingly.
Step 2: Run the script to load, process, and visualize the traffic data.
Step 3: The script will generate:
A bar chart of vehicles over time (DateTime).
A bar chart showing total vehicles at each junction.
A radar chart displaying the average vehicle count per hour.
Example usage:

bash
Copy code
python traffic_data_visualization.py
This will display all three visualizations (bar charts and radar chart) to analyze traffic data.

Troubleshooting
FileNotFoundError: Ensure the path to the .zip file is correct and that the file exists.
Missing Columns: Ensure that the dataset includes DateTime, Vehicles, and Junction. If not, you might need to adjust the column names or update the script to match the dataset structure.
Incorrect Data Format: Make sure the DateTime column is in a format that pandas can parse. If it's in a different format, consider preprocessing the data to ensure it's in the correct form.
Conclusion
This project allows you to visualize traffic patterns using different types of plots:

Bar charts for traffic volume over time and by junction.
Radar chart for cyclic traffic patterns by hour.
The code can be modified to include other forms of analysis or visualizations, depending on your needs.
